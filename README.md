# Speech Synthesis And Perception With Envelope Cue
This is our course project for Signals and Systems. We use MATLAB to simulate the cilia principle of the human ear for a software simulation implementation of a cochlear implant. The project explores the process of synthesis and perception of sound and explores the role of envelope in it, the effect of each parameter. The results were finally implemented on a DT hardware development board. The physical results are in the [video](https://github.com/Wendy-Ying/Speech-Synthesis-And-Perception-With-Envelope-Cue/blob/main/%E7%A1%AC%E4%BB%B6%E6%95%88%E6%9E%9C%E6%BC%94%E7%A4%BA%E8%A7%86%E9%A2%91.mp4).
